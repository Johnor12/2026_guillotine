    """Fixed point: wire value -> draft -> wire value.

    The map is piecewise-constant: the wire level jumps between adjacent players in the
    pool instead of moving continuously. That means gradient-style damping cannot settle
    it — it just orbits the discontinuity — while plain undamped iteration is eventually
    periodic.

    So iterate undamped, watch for a repeated state, and average the wire levels over
    the cycle once one closes. Each iteration's draft is a deterministic function of the
    previous one's wire levels, so the state key is the wire levels alone. A cycle of
    length 1 is an exact fixed point; a longer cycle means the draft genuinely
    alternates between neighbouring league shapes and the average across it is the
    honest answer. The cycle is reported rather than hidden.

    Every draft here starts from `board`, so on a live board the fixed point is over the
    rosters this league will actually finish with. The measurement is still league-wide:
    the wire is whatever the whole league leaves undrafted.
